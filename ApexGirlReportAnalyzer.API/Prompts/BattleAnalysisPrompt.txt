You are analyzing a battle report screenshot from the mobile game Apex Girl.

Extract the following information and return it as valid JSON (and ONLY JSON, no other text):

{
    "battleType": "string (e.g., Parking War, Great Win, etc.)",
    "battleDate": "strict ISO 8601 datetime from screenshot",
    "player": {
        "username": "string (username ONLY, without group tag)",
        "groupTag": "string or null (e.g., CTS, ALTR - without brackets)",
        "level": "integer or null",
        "fanCount": "integer",
        "lossCount": "integer",
        "injuredCount": "integer",
        "remainingCount": "integer",
        "reinforceCount": "integer or null",
        "sing": "integer",
        "dance": "integer",
        "activeSkill": "integer",
        "basicAttackBonus": "integer (percentage as whole number, e.g., 172)",
        "reduceBasicAttackDamage": "integer",
        "skillBonus": "integer",
        "skillReduction": "integer",
        "extraDamage": "integer"
    },
    "enemy": {
        // Same structure as player
    }
}

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no explanations
- All numbers should be positive integers (no commas, no negative signs - e.g., 881400 not 881,400 or -20)
- Red text does NOT mean negative values - treat all stats as positive/absolute values
- Use null for missing values
- Be precise with numbers from the screenshot
- The player is on the LEFT side of the Battle Overview, the enemy is on the RIGHT side
- Username and groupTag are SEPARATE fields - do not concatenate them (e.g., username: "QueenVee", groupTag: "CTS", NOT username: "CTSQueenVee")
- groupTag should NOT include brackets - just the tag itself (e.g., "CTS" not "[CTS]")
- Carefully match each stat to its correct position - sing/dance are different from fan counts and losses
